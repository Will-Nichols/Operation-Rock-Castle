                "In mid-2018 the Russian military acting upon the recently announced expansionist policies of the re-elected President and ruling party began to move troops and material to the small island territory of Napf in the Baltic Sea. The island nation broke away from the former Soviet Union in the early 1990’s but has been unable to move forward economically and has been unsuccessful in its attempts to integrate with the European Union or NATO. With the looming threat of global financial crisis and some newly found minerals in the southern part of the island let the island burst onto the economic and global scene. However, this was short lived as the minerals were determined to be useful but not overly so and only a minor need for most nations…other than Russia who was determined to bring Napf back under the banner of the revived Russian Bear to put pressure on the nations of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania to rejoin the Russian nation or at least go the way of Belarus and ally themselves with Russia to protect themselves. On July 10th, 2018, the Russian military staged a massive overflight of fighters and transports over the nation of Estonia to invade Napf. In part, this was a show of force to the Estonian government that the Russians could and would do whatever they needed to regain these small nations and to retake Napf as quickly as possible. The Russian military forces landed at the International Airport in the north and at a former Soviet airbase in the extreme south. They did not land in the west as there was a small contingent of US forces there completing the final phases of a military exercise in which and the small Napf defense forces had begun just 3 weeks prior. This in effect sent a major shockwave through Washington DC as the US forces were scheduled to be pulled out with a small naval force of an LHD and supporting ships to the Polish port of Gdansk in just over a week. As the Russians continued to build up forces on the island the US local commander made sure his men were staying close to their extraction point but he was also making sure that the Pentagon had an updated notification of all Russian activity within 10km of his location. The US Air Force sent a small CAS and CAP contingent to the island and they patrolled over the airbase and to the southwest to ensure that sea lanes were open for business. During this time frame the US and Russia were engaged in significant talks via both ambassadors and the US requirement that the Russians leave Napf immediately were falling on deaf ears as was the Russian requirement that the US just shut up and leave as well. This led to a small skirmish between US and Russian forces near the villages of Buckten and Schagen. No major injuries were reported but the Russians opened fire on the US forces who were in those villages as scouts to report on Russian forces moving their way. This led to a breakdown of negotiations completely and a message was sent to the US commander to prepare for combat at their earliest opportunity. Fortunately, the US Air Force had brought in enough ammunition over the last several days to allow the US Army forces on the ground to have several days of combat operations without worrying about resupply. In the late-night hours of July 30th, 2018, the US Army unit began combat operations against the Russian MSV forces on the island to the direct north.<br/><br/>
				
				(2) Capabilities: Russian 2nd Guards Motor Rifle Division and elements of the 4th Guard Tank Division are on Napf and are now reforming to counter-attack the US 2nd Brigade Combat Team elements who launched the attack on their southwestern flank late last night.<br/><br/>b. Friendly Forces - Task Force Red:<br/><br/>2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division and attached US Air Force units will utilize the callsigns, Phantom and Firehawk. These forces will be responsible for all ground and air combat operations within Beketov.<br/><br/>"
